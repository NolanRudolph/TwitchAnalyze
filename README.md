	<b>Data Mining for Twitch Chat</b>
</p>

<p>  
	I wanted to become more experienced with Python sockets and generating graphs, so I decided to make this project. Essentially, it will constantly scan a chat on some Twitch page to find several statistics about the chat, be it the top poster, most used icons, most frequent donater, etc. My program will then automatically output a graph for you at the end of its analysis, tied together by a easy to use bash shell script.
